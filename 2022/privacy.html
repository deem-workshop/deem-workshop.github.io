        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <div style="display: block; text-align: justify;">
          <p>Like most website operators, deem-workshop.org collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. deem-workshop.org’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how its visitors use its website. From time to time, emancipatory-datascience.org may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

          <p>deem-workshop.org also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Emancipatory-datascience.org does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

          <p><strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>

          <p>deem-workshop will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. deem-workshop takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

          <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

          <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. deem-workshop.org uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of deem-workshop.org website, and their website access preferences. deem-workshop.org visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using emancipatory-datascience.org, with the drawback that certain features of the website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

          <p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong></p>

          <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, deem-workshop.org may change its privacy policy from time to time, and in its sole discretion. deem-workshop.org encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its privacy policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this privacy policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
